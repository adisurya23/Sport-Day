# Sport-Day
This is Swift project using CoreLocation and MapKit to track an exercise route and time. It was written in Swift 2.2 on XCode 7.3.1.

The project was written by John Morales, Adi Surya and Alex Wapniarski as part of a 24-hour hackathon at the Coding Dojo in San Jose, CA.

The project should be considered early beta at this point. It does allow the user to plot a series of checkpoints, and will then plot a suggested route to match.

Plans for the completed project include a proper timer, with time tracking for each leg, persistant data to store routes, track average and best times for each leg and route, and voice prompts with feedback comparing current time to the average and best times.
